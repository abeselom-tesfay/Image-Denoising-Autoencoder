## Image Denoising Autoencoder

### Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based image denoising system using a residual autoencoder architecture. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset to remove Gaussian noise from images while preserving important structural details. The project demonstrates modern computer vision techniques for image restoration tasks.

### Technical Approach
#### Architecture
The model employs a convolutional autoencoder with residual blocks to enhance training stability and feature preservation. The architecture includes:

- **Encoder**: Series of convolutional layers with max-pooling for feature extraction
- **Bottleneck**: Compressed representation learning
- **Decoder**: Transposed convolutions for image reconstruction
- **Residual** Connections: Skip connections to mitigate vanishing gradient problems

#### Noise Model
Gaussian noise with variance 0.01 is added to clean CIFAR-10 images to create training and testing pairs for the denoising task.

#### Performance Results
The trained model achieves competitive denoising performance:

- **PSNR**: 28.26 dB (average on test set)
- **SSIM**: 0.84 (average on test set)

Comparative analysis shows significant improvement over traditional denoising methods:

- +6-8 dB PSNR improvement over noisy inputs
- +3-4 dB PSNR improvement over wavelet denoising methods

#### Key Features
- Residual block implementation for improved gradient flow
